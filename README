Edit settings.py to point to a database which has been set up for
postgis.

[table_name] is the name of a table to hold Tiger data.  Download the 
Tiger data from:
http://www2.census.gov/cgi-bin/shapefiles/county-files?county=36061


$ shp2pgsql tl_2008_36061_edges.shp -s 4326 [table_name]|psql -d [database_name]

$ ./manage.py syncdb
$ ./manage.py tiger_import [table_name] 
$ ./manage.py create_bus_route tracker/nyc_bus_routes.txt

You may now drop [table_name], if you like.
